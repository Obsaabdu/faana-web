    "faq3Question": "Can I trademark my company name?",
    "faq3Answer": "Yes, company names can be trademarked if they're distinctive and used in commerce. We conduct comprehensive searches to ensure your mark doesn't conflict with existing marks and handle the registration process.",
    "faq4Question": "What should I do if someone is infringing my IP rights?",
