        <li>Enforce rights to maintain distinctiveness</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Trade Secrets</h2>
      <p>Not everything should or can be patented:</p>
      
      <h3>Trade Secret Protection</h3>
      <ul>

        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Limit access on need-to-know basis</li>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality Agreements:</strong> Use NDAs with employees and partners</li>
        <li><strong>Technical Safeguards:</strong> Implement digital security measures</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Copyright Considerations</h2>
      <p>Copyright protection arises automatically but registration provides benefits:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Register important works for enhanced protection</li>
        <li>Ensure work-for-hire agreements are in place</li>

      <p>Startups can protect IP on limited budgets:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize most valuable innovations</li>
        <li>Use provisional patents strategically</li>
        <li>Leverage trade secret protection where appropriate</li>
        <li>Consider patent cooperation treaties for international protection</li>
        <li>Build relationships with IP-focused law firms</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
